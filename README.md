## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Brushed up my flexbox skills
- Learnt about responsive design
- Learnt about image overlays

### Useful resources

- [Image Overlay Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wV4Har4xkQ) - Since I didn't know about complex topics like ::after and ::before elements, I just found this great youtube video which just works for this particular challenge. It's not the best but it does the job.
- [Best Flexbox Guide you can have](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - If you don't know about flexbox, this is the best guide or cheatsheet you can find on the entire internet. It's great for pros as well as for beginners.
